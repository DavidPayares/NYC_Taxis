## Analysis

* [Data exploration and cleaning](https://github.com/DavidPayares/NYC_Taxis/blob/main/notebooks/Data%20Exploration%20and%20Cleaning.ipynb): basic visualizations and datacleaning. Initial screening of variables and possible relations between them.
* [Data summary](https://github.com/DavidPayares/NYC_Taxis/blob/main/notebooks/Data%20Summary.ipynb): most important insights into the data. Temporal and spatial visualizations. Further cleaning and generation of new candidate regressors.
* [Model building](https://github.com/DavidPayares/neuronorm/tree/main/inst): modeling of the tip amount. Use of two models, multiple linear regression and random forest.
